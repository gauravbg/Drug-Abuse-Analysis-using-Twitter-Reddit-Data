 @seanspicer says trump supports medical marihuana. wants to enforce laws against recreational weed.
 @kellyo why isnt rec marijuana a states rights thing too
 so spicer uses opiod addiction as reason for recreational marijuana to be against the law
 @presssec how is the transgender bathroom issue a states rights thing and rec marijuana not
 @foxnews legalize marijuana recreational and medical the government has zero rights  to dictate what plants we can  amp cant use
 soooo according to spicertrump  trans bathroom issue is state issue but rec marijuana is a fed issue fuck these people
 of why recreational usage shouldnt be allowed. does he know medical marijuana is used to treat opioid addiction 
 wait im confused transgender issues are a states right matter but legal marijuana isnt it was universe does that make sense @presssec
 so marijuana is a fed issue but transgender rights are a state issue smdh @presssec what a joke
 also  funny how seanspicersays lgbt protections are states rights  but marijuana legalization is not. resist resisttrump
 hb 1204 up next  bill would legalize industrial hemp sdleg
 if you believe in returning power to the states  shouldnt you unilaterally before states being allowed to legalize marijuana right 
 wait im confused transgender issues are a states right matter but legal marijuana isnt in what universe does that make sense @presssec
 @realdonaldtrump sir  states should have the right to legalize recreational marijuana if the majority of people vote for its use.
 if you believe in returning power to the states  shouldnt you unilaterally be for states being allowed to legalize marijuana right 
 transgender equality is a states rights issue but legal marijuana is a federal priority statesrights 
 doj trans rights are a state issue  but smoking reefer over the line @popehat 
 so states should be able to decide who lives or dies but cant decide if they want their citizens to smoke pot 
 trump is sending the doj to enforce pot laws. russia isnt viewed as a threat. but so help us if youre transgender or want to smoke...
 marijuana is under attack by trump and sessions. what does spicer mean when he says they will take action against legal weed
 leave it up to states to discriminate against trans people but federal laws for punishing states that legalized marijuana cool.
 transgender issues go to the states. med marijuana  2 feds freecalifornia caexit calexit bipolardonnie

 transgender protections  states rights issue   but marijuana ...

 @presssec isnt the use of marijuana a state issue its an all or nothing scenario. bathrooms are state issues and pot is a fed issue 
 im not gonna vote  its not like we can legalize weed anymore  @spookybuddy
 so let me get this straight the transgender bathroom issue is tied to states rights  but legal marijuana is not. 
 @realdonaldtrump your little group of nazis are idiots to try amp change states rights as voted on to legalize marijuana. legalize drugs save
  rt @radleybalko spicer doj will be taking action against states that have legalized recreational marijuana.

 i guess states right is ok unless its rec weed doj is going 2 go hard on rec weed  now my state pass rec weed now a crime wrong state rights

 hey spicey  states should be able to decide discrimination  but they shouldnt be able legalize rec. marijuana really
 fire dept. is getting ready for the medical marijuana public forum in niles @ 6. cleared out the trucks for 200 sea 
 so apparently it should be a states right to choose whether to protect lgbt children  but not a right to legalize rec. marijuana wtf
 i wonder if trump will reclassify medical marijuana and get it off the schedule 1 listtotally stupid to classify weed with meth and heroin
 trumps next target states that legalized weed get rid of this clown 
 @girlsgun to bad the gop just shit on states rights with a crackdown on marijuana. this opens up using the same to take guns
 @geraldorivera @realdonaldtrump because federal marijuana laws exist and federal title 9 law about transgender do not. laws
 are you allowed to smoke pot in the bahamas someone lmk
 so transgender bathrooms are a states rights issue  but state level marijuana laws are not the next 24 years wil 
 spicer doj will be taking action against states that have legalized recreational marijuana. not what candidate t 
 .@presssec harm trans kids because states rights  @presssec well be clamping down on state marijuana laws because the supremacy clause
 @brandontmartin @holtjeffrey i would run your asses over  sell some for your medical bills then we would smoke the 
 republicans believe that states rights are important when it comes to abortion but not cannabis.  fucking hypocrites.
 so civil rights are a states issue but weed is a federal issue whatever rolls with your agenda i guess. 
 @peoplesoracle white ppl take ls as long as black and brown ppl suffer at a greater rate. attacking legal weed is a direct attack on whites
 @billjpiper we know but if they go after marijuana just think of all the gop states rights issues that now become open for discussion. guns
 voters vote to legalize weed but spicy cites opiod problem which your doctor is prescribing legally to you as why i 
 i cant believe were talking about legal weed in this country right now when there are so many bigger issues. what a joke. actually sad.
 we want smaller government and let the states decide. oh unless you wanna sit in your house and smoke weed. then fu 
 @radleybalko they should. theres a federal law that places marijuana as a controlled substance. states cannot choose what laws to follow.
 @billjpiper for fear of little old marijuana. how fitting.
 especially when they crack down on states that have legalized marijuana. 
 @kriswernowsky @radleybalko theres a federal law regarding marijuana. its not about states rights then  its about the supremacy clause.
 @peoplesoracle the legalization of weed is also very popular in the battleground states of florida and arizona.
 i love my job helping matchmake the right partners in the cannabis industry and crafting marketing plans amp advertising campaigns that work
 because legalized weed didnt do anything positive for the states that legalized it... just look at colorado carna 
 in trumps childlike brain  the safety of trans kids isnt any concern of federal government  but adults smoking weed must be stopped
 if theyre trying to increase the prison population going after legal weed makes sense 
 spicer doj will be taking action against states that have legalized recreational marijuana. 
 @potus @realdonaldtrump so personal bathroom preference is states issue but weed still a fed issue give power to states legalize taxes
 im at smokem if you got em  @smokemnorthshor in mandeville  louisiana

 soooooo states rights on bathrooms but not on immigration or weed @realdonaldtrump @potus @seanspicer pick a side
 white house cracking down on legal weed states is a bad move  legal weed is a tax gold mine... very sad

 @thedomains @radleybalko @aaronwall more people voted for weed than this potus @repblumenauer

 if youre active in resisting trump  supporting @aclu  if youre vocal  throw away your marijuana asap. govt may use it to arrest you.
 @jeremyinakron spicer just said doj will take actions against states that have legalized recreational marijuana. thoughts
 trump administration signals new war on drugs  crackdown on marijuana use by @atrupar 
 transgender bathrooms are a state issue  forget what states say  federal marijuana laws need to be enforced.  
 states rights on bathroom laws for transgender  but not if its okay to smoke a plant 
 transfriendly bathrooms states rights. states legalizing marijuana in their own states not states rights.  
 how is recreational marijuana a federal issue  but rights for trans kids a state issue i do not understand. 
 the latest justice may crack down on legalized marijuana  bernie millennials that switched to trump learn a lesson  
 @kolakjason @plazmyk it relaxes the mind thats why so many people with anxiety amp depression smoke it. helps with pain too
 but marijuana and thccbd products could compete with the pharmaceutical industry  because competition is the last thing we need  right
 so if you voted for trump  and have your marijuana card  guess what. its not legal and hes coming for you next.
 i got all the weed from  a different mind state
 sean spicer suggests trump admin. may crack down on states that have legalized recreational marijuana 
 i like how the marijuana campaign went from legalize weed for more money to legalize weed to steal money from the cartel 
 if @potus had a meeting with medical cannabis ceos  i think it would be enlightening and helpful in shaping cannabis policy. @seanspicer
 not sure if the voters who support legalized cannabis are likely to mobilize and vote... 
 going after states rights on legal weed but not intervening in trans issues when its obviously a civil rights issue......go fuck yourself
 and we will shut them down.  cannabis legalization is the front line in states rights. 
 if @realdonaldtrump had a meeting with medical cannabis ceos  i think it would be enlightening and helpful. @seanspicer
 this mf trump tryna make weed illegal again in all those states smh
 who will be the weed czar 
 @turrentwolfie so trangender issues should be a states right while marijuana isnt even though citizens of the stated voted for it
 trump believes in states right to discriminate against trans kids...but not to legalize recreational marijuana. 
 spicer is suggesting the trump administration may crack down on states that have legalized recreational marijuana. 
 @eevee @chipfoxx states dont habe the right to make laws that override federal regulation. they never have. with weed the obama admin gt
 i hope weed isnt one of the things trump takes from us.
 @potus will not not get my vote again amp ill have to stop defending potus if his administration doesnt reschedule cannabis.
 one things coincide with private jails mass incarceration usually low level drug offenses so penalties states legalize marijuana makes sense

 @realdonaldtrump  wow  some gift you gave to @jeffsessions  was it for his birthday he gets to play god in states rights amp hunt for weed.
 spicer states will likely see greater enforcement of federal law against rec marijuana
